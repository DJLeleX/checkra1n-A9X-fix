NOTES: 

(!) As of November 24th 2021, checkra1n still didn't fix this issue / release a new update so this method still works.

Also, soon, I will be making a new guide (with pictures) on how to use this script as it was complicated for many people.


Requirements: 

- iPad Pro 9.7-inch (2016) or iPad Pro 12.9-inch (2015) with iOS 14.5 or higher
- checkra1n.app installed & located in the Applications folder, if it's not there, move it to there or change the path in the script

--------------------------------------------------

How to use this script:

Download the file "PongoConsolidated.bin" from this link:
https://github.com/checkra1n/BugTracker/files/6429930/Pongo.zip

Extract it.

Navigate to /Applications/checkra1n.app/Contents

Create a new folder named "A9X" inside it. 

Put the file "PongoConsolidated.bin" into the A9X folder.

Run the script.

Plug in the iPad, in Options mark "Allow untested iOS/iPadOS/tvOS versions".

Jailbreak your A9X device.
